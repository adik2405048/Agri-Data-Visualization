# Agri-Data-Visualization
Project: An Interactive Agri Data Visualization Dashboard!
Turning raw data into actionable insights, I built this web application to explore and analyze agricultural production trends in Bangladesh. This dashboard was developed entirely in Html & later on tried on Python. I used the powerful Streamlit library to create the interactive web interface, Pandas for robust data manipulation, and Plotly to generate beautiful, responsive charts and graphs.

Key Features:
• Dynamic Filtering: Users can interactively filter the data by year, crop, and division to drill down into specific insights.

• Multiple Visualizations: The dashboard includes bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs to visualize production data from different angles.

• High-Level Metrics: Key performance indicators provide an instant summary of total and average production based on the selected filters.

• Clean Web Interface: The entire application is presented in a clean, user-friendly web interface that is easy to navigate.

This tool makes complex agricultural data accessible and understandable for policymakers, researchers, students, and anyone interested in the agricultural sector. Identifying trends in crop production over time. Comparing the performance of different divisions. Making informed, data-driven decisions for agricultural planning and development. This project was a fantastic learning experience in building end-to-end data applications with Python. I'm always open to feedback and suggestions for new features!
